The goal of this project is to create a sandbox for testing algorithms on the Traveling Salesman problem. This project is primarily focused on using AI to create these algorithms. As such, a large portion of this project is focused on creating a "MachineInterface" that will allow machine learning/AI algorithms to dynamically create algorithms.
