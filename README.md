The goal of this project is to create a sandbox for testing algorithms on the Traveling Salesman problem. This project is primarily focused on using AI to create these algorithms. As such, a large portion of this project is focused on creating a "MachineInterface" that will allow machine learning/AI algorithms to dynamically create algorithms.

##### Recent updates:
1/27/18: Added contribution guidelines.
___
##### Language(s):
Currently this project only uses Python. Python was chosen for two main reasons: 
1. Python's wide adoption in the ML/AI space.
2. Python's ability to dynamically execute code.
___
##### Usage:
TO DO: Add usage documentation once further progress is made on machine interface.
___
##### Contribution guidelines:
If you would like to contribute to this project, I'd ask that you follow the contribution guidelines in the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
___
##### Current Project Status: In-Development
The current focus of this project is on developing the MachineInterface module.
Other low hanging fruit include:
- Adding more documentation to current modules/github.
- Adding contribution guidelines for community support. -- Completed 1/27/18 --
- Creating a visualizer module (tsvisualizer) to visualize a TSProblem graph. -- Completed 1/25/18 --
- Creating an algorithm benchmarking module with visualizer.
- Adding a wiki for the project.
